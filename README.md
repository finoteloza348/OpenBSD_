# `madvise(2)` System Call on OpenBSD

This repository documents the usage, behavior, and example code for the `madvise(2)` system call on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/). The `madvise()` function is used to give advice or directions to the kernel about the intended usage pattern of memory.

## ðŸ“˜ What is `madvise()`?

The `madvise()` system call allows a program to tell the operating system how it intends to use a specified region of memory. This can help the kernel make decisions about paging and caching to optimize performance.
